## A simple web app that allows users to chat online.


#### It is built using the ```ws``` API and the WebSocket Protocol on the frontend.

### How it's built.

1. ##### Create 2 folders ```server``` and ```client```

2. ##### In the root run ```npm i ws express unique-names-generator uuid --save```

 This will install all dependencies our server needs. We installed them in the root to avoid issues when deploying to heroku.
 
 
 ##### Navigate to the server folder and create an ```index.js``` file.
 This is where all the logic for the server will be written.
